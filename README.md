# Spotifind ðŸŽ§
Spotifind is a Go-based library designed to search Spotify playlists for contact info.
It extracts contact information and musical styles from playlists, providing a comprehensive overview of the playlists' content.
Works pretty similar to paid services like PlaylistSupply and Distrokid's playlist engine, but free and open-source.

If you're looking for the app, you need to go [here](https://github.com/je09/spotifind-app)

## Features
- **Search Playlists**: Search for playlists based on specific criteria.
- **Extract Contacts**: Extract contact information from playlist descriptions.
- **Analyze Styles**: Analyze and categorize musical styles from playlists.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track the progress of playlist processing.

# Use in your own projects
Spotifind is designed as a library, so you can use it in your own projects.
Todo so, you can use go get command:
```bash
go get github.com/je09/spotifind
```

Then you can import the library in your project:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/je09/spotifind"
)

func main() {
	auth := spotifind.SpotifindAuth{
		ClientID:     "client_id",
		ClientSecret: "client_secret",
	}

	s, err := spotifind.NewSpotifind(auth, false)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// ch - channel for search results
	ch := make(spotifind.SpotifindChan)

	// pCh - channel for progress of the scan
	pCh := make(spotifind.ProgressChan)

	// Search for playlists on popular markets
	go func() {
		err = s.SearchPlaylistPopular(
			ch,
			pCh,
			[]string{"liquidfunk", "autonomic", "microfunk"}, // your search queries, just like the ones you'd type in the Spotify search bar
			[]string{"techno", "metal", "punk"})              // ignore these strings in description and name of the playlist
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}()

	// Output the progress of the scan
	go func() {
		for progress := range pCh {
			fmt.Printf("Progress: %d out of %d\n", progress.Done, progress.Total)
		}
	}()

	// Output found playlists
	for playlist := range ch {
		fmt.Printf("Playlist: %s has contacts %v\n", playlist.Playlist.Name, playlist.Playlist.Contacts)
	}
}
```
